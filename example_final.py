"""
Final working example of sdag computational DAG with trigger-based evaluation.
This example properly demonstrates:
1. Arena-style graph storage with node sharing
2. Trigger-based evaluation (only outputs when trigger changes)
3. Multiple evaluation engines

# with mid as the root (trigger). The arena engine evaluates in topological order.
# So we create a dummy node that uses both, then freeze from mid.

# and we'll tell the sampler that mid is the trigger by its index
